# SignEase
SignEase is a Web Application which is tailored for the ISL users and also the beginners aiming to learn and understand ISL better for better understanding within our community and better inclusivity. 
This project, titled "SignEase," addresses the significant communication gap between Indian Sign Language (ISL) users and the general population. Despite the Indian Government's initiatives to standardize ISL, the availability of accessible technology for real-time ISL translation remains limited. Current solutions predominantly focus on American Sign Language (ASL), leaving ISL users underserved. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a web application that provides real-time ISL translation, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to translate gestures into spoken or written language. The outcome of this project has the potential to enhance inclusivity and accessibility for ISL users in various contexts, including education, healthcare, and public services.
